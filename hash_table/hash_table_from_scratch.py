# 1. NOTE: Handle collisions as well.
# We are using Chaining to handle collisions.
# if len(list)=2, there is a 50% chance that 2 strings will want to use same index. So
# instead of storing a (key,val) pair at each index instead store a list of key,val pairs.

# 2. NOTE: Load Factor.
# 1. if there are n keys, and b is the size of hash table. Then Load Factor = n/b
# 2. Load Factor (0.75 usually) is kept low so that there are less number of entries at one index, and lookup time is almost constant.
# 3. A high load factor means less space overhead but more lookup time and viceversa.

# 3. We will soon get to 100% collisions as all our indexes are populated, and now we will be doing linear
# lookups instead of constant ones. So why dont we just start with 1024 size. We can but it will take lot of memory even for a small smallest hash table.

# SOLUTION: keep the size flexible.
# Expand whenever hash table becomes too populated.
# start with len of 4 and double it to 8,16, 32..  as and when required.
